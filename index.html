      <p>Saw it today with my friends, and loved it. It is better to have an understanding fo the MCU UNIVERSE before embarking into the quest of viewing this movie, for a minimal understanding of the events to occur in the screen. Best thing I liked, and that can't be denied, was the quality and the efficiency of the VFX, throughout the clip. It felt like everything was real to me, although it wasn't! With great enjoyment, came the moment of relief when YOU KNOW WHO was killed, but that also came with a big sacrifice, which was the saddest thing of all, THE DEATH OF HIM AND HER XC XC... (SPOILER ALERT)</p>

        South Australia's 900km Mawson Trail journeys through sites so ancient, they've revealed the imprints of animals that lived 555 million years ago â€“ likely the earliest human ancestor. This outbreak of common-disovery ccam along our venture across the mountainous-grasslands. Along the way, many plateau's and deserted area's were required to be passed, along our bike-tour. The fruitful journey throughout the area, provided us some ancient relics/memories to dream about, on return to home.

      <h4>Climate change and farming driving insect decline</h4>

        Insect numbers have plunged by half in some parts of the world due to climate change and intensive agriculture, a study has found. The combined pressures of global heating and farming are driving a "substantial decline" of insects across the globe, according to UK researchers. They say we must acknowledge the threats we pose to insects, before some species are lost forever. But preserving habitat for nature could help ensure vital insects thrive. Lead researcher, Dr Charlie Outhwaite of UCL, said losing insect populations could be harmful not only to the natural environment, but to "human health and food security, particularly with losses of pollinators". Plummeting populations of insects around the world - a so-called "insect apocalypse" - have caused widespread concern. However, scientific data gives a mixed picture, with some types of insects showing drastic declines, while others are staying steady. In the latest study, the researchers pulled together data on the range and number of nearly 20,000 insect species, including bees, ants, butterflies, grasshoppers and dragonflies, at about 6,000 different locations. In areas with high-intensity agriculture and substantial warming, insect numbers have plunged by 49% and the number of different species by 27%, compared with relatively untouched places that have so far avoided the most severe impacts of climate change, according to the research, published in Nature. But the researchers said there was some cause for hope in that setting aside areas of land for nature created a refuge for insects, which need shade to survive in hot weather.</p>

      <h4>Got food cravings? What's living in your gut may be responsible</h4>

        New research on mice shows for the first time that the microbes in animals' guts influence what they choose to eat, making substances that prompt cravings for different kinds of foods.Despite decades of speculation by scientists about whether microbes could influence our preferred diets, the idea has never been directly tested in animals bigger than a fruit fly. To explore the question, Kohl and his postdoc Brian Trevelline (A&S '08), now at Cornell University, gave 30 mice that lacked gut microbes a cocktail of microorganisms from three species of wild rodents with very different natural diets. The duo found that mice in each group chose food rich in different nutrients, showing that their microbiome changed their preferred diet. The researchers published their work today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

          <p class = "P_modal">For soccer enthusiasts and sports fans in general, an in-depth look at the life of the beautiful gameâ€™s greatest star, Argentine footballer Lionel Messi. <br> Whether you call it soccer, football, fÃºtbol, or the â€œbeautiful game," it is the most popular sport in the world, and Argentine footballer Lionel Messi stands as one of its finest playersâ€”not only of his time, but of all time. Admired around the globe for his athleticism, skill, and fierce competitiveness, Messi has, at the age of 24, already shattered records at one of the most storied clubs in the world, FC Barcelona. Now, in this comprehensive biography, Messi fans can learn more about his life and career. Argentine journalist Leonardo Faccio describes how Messi, as a talented youth player in Buenos Aires, left his home for Spain in search of the medical help his family could not afford to treat his rare hormone deficiency. Small of stature, but possessing tremendous natural gifts, Messi developed into a star at Barcelonaâ€™s famed Masia soccer school. In this book, Faccio has written not only a biography of an enigmatic celebrity, but a meditation on athletic genius, drawing on interviews with Messi himself, as well as with everyone from his family, teammates, childhood friendsâ€”even his favorite butcher. In-depth and intimate, soccer fans who enjoy watching Messi come alive on the field will delight as he comes alive on the page.<br>
